Processing:

Lead in to debate text can be removed, for example:

"Women and Equalities \n The Minister for Women and Equalities was asked—"
"Prime Minister \n The Prime Minister was asked— \n Engagements \n"

Individual topics may need to be removed in non-PMQ debates.

Numbered questions (in non-PMQ debates) may be removed as they are not signed or spoken. For example:

"12. What steps are the government taking to..."

Check that (a) the signer does not sign them long form, and (b) if we ought to replace these with for example:

"Number 12 [please] mister speaker"

Members' names can be retained, but double check that the signer usually signs the name of the member.

ALL content in square brackets and parentheses may be removed. For example:

"Neil Gray (Airdrie and Shotts) (SNP) [V]"

Add spaces before and after punctuation, they are kept together in Hansard, for example:

"here…in response"
"John Hume—a man"
